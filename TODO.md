# TODO's

## Features
### Must have
- Implement solving algorithm(s).

### Nice to have
- Animation for updating cube size (scale down to 0 before despawn, scale up from 0 to 1 at spawn)
- UI button to scramble instantly (without animations)
- Disable scramble and solve button while a sequence is being performed
- Show full scramble sequence as text (make current move pop out)
- Automatically move the camera so the cube takes up the same amount of space on the screen, no matter the cube size.
- Better lighting
- Sykbox
- Some rectangle underneath so it is not just floating in the air
- Algorithm with optimal solving strategy ('Gods algorithm'). This is expected to take about 10 seconds to calculate. To prevent lag it will have to be either done on a separate thread or spread out over multiple ticks.
