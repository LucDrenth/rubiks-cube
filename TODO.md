# TODO's

## Features
### Must have
- UI button to scramble instantly (without animations)
- UI buttons to update cube size
- Implement solving algorithm(s).

### Nice to have
- Automatically move the camera so the cube takes up the same amount of space on the screen, no matter the cube size.
- Better lighting
- Sykbox
- Some rectangle underneath so it is not just floating in the air
