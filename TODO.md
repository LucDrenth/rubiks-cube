# TODO's

## Features
### Must have
- UI button to scramble with animations
- UI button to scramble instantly (without animations)
- UI button to run solver
- Implement solving algorithm(s).

### Nice to have
- Automatically move the camera so the cube takes up the same amount of space on the screen, no mather the cube size.

## Bugs
- Rotating slices breaks after doing a cube rotation on the X axis (arrow left / arrow right). Can be reproduces by pressing 'W' to do a cube rotation and then doing some rotations with either the 'Space' or the 'Tab' key.
